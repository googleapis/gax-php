/**
 * Response object for paged results from a list API method
 *
 * The PagedListResponse object is returned by API methods that implement
 * pagination, and makes it easier to access multiple pages of results
 * without having to manually manipulate page tokens. Pages are retrieved
 * lazily, with additional API calls being made as additional results
 * are required.
 *
 * The list elements can be accessed in the following ways:
 *  - As a single iterable using the iterateAllElements method
 *  - As pages fo elements, using the getPage and iteratePages methods
 *  - As fixed size collections of elements, using the
 *    getFixedSizeCollection and iterateFixedSizeCollections methods
 *
 * @param array $params {
 *     The parameters used to make the API call.
 *     @type object the request object
 *     @type array the metadata
 *     @type array the options of the API call
 * }
 * @param \Google\GAX\ApiCallable $callable the callable object that makes the API method calls.
 * @param \Google\GAX\PageStreamingDescriptor $pageStreamingDescriptor the descriptor that
 *     contains the field names related to page-streaming.
