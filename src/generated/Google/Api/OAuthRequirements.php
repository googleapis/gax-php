/**
 * <pre>
 * OAuth scopes are a way to define data and permissions on data. For example,
 * there are scopes defined for "Read-only access to Google Calendar" and
 * "Access to Cloud Platform". Users can consent to a scope for an application,
 * giving it permission to access that data on their behalf.
 * OAuth scope specifications should be fairly coarse grained; a user will need
 * to see and understand the text description of what your scope means.
 * In most cases: use one or at most two OAuth scopes for an entire family of
 * products. If your product has multiple APIs, you should probably be sharing
 * the OAuth scope across all of those APIs.
 * When you need finer grained OAuth consent screens: talk with your product
 * management about how developers will use them in practice.
 * Please note that even though each of the canonical scopes is enough for a
 * request to be accepted and passed to the backend, a request can still fail
 * due to the backend requiring additional scopes or permissions.
 * </pre>
