 * log is sent to both the producer and consumer projects, whereas the
 * `purchase_history` log is only sent to the producer project.

 *       - key: /name
 *         description: The name of the branch.
 *     logs:
 *     - name: activity_history
 *       labels:
 *       - key: /customer_id
 *     - name: purchase_history
 *     logging:
